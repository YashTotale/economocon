        To measure our progress on these issues, we can look at metrics that
        track the economic health of nations and the world in general. The main
        metric that does so is the
        <strong>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</strong>, the value of the goods
        and services produced by a country. We can also look at the{" "}
        <strong>unemployment rate</strong> of countries around the world to get
        a sense of their economic health.
